## Sales-Revenue-Tracker

This is a fully functional VBA model built in Excel that uses **custom UserForms** for tracking, editing, and managing sales data â€” no need for direct interaction with sheets. Designed with usability and access control in mind, the project simulates a real-world CRM-lite tool tailored for sales pipeline management and reporting.

Key Features:
- VBA-powered UserForms for data entry, updates, and deletion
- Dynamic record referencing and data validation
- Protected backend sheet with button-based UI triggers
- Integration with Power Query for external raw data pulls
- Clean UI logic, form validations, and modular code design
